/// 
/// On Windows, note that all the string or string vector arguments to
/// this function and the other `g_spawn*()` functions are in UTF-8, the
/// GLib file name encoding. Unicode characters that are not part of
/// the system codepage passed in these arguments will be correctly
/// available in the spawned program only if it uses wide character API
/// to retrieve its command line. For C programs built with Microsoft's
/// tools it is enough to make the program have a ``wmain()`` instead of
/// ``main()``. ``wmain()`` has a wide character argument vector as parameter.
/// 
/// At least currently, mingw doesn't support ``wmain()``, so if you use
/// mingw to develop the spawned program, it should call
/// `g_win32_get_command_line()` to get arguments in UTF-8.
/// 
/// On Windows the low-level child process creation API ``CreateProcess()``
/// doesn't use argument vectors, but a command line. The C runtime
/// library's `spawn*()` family of functions (which `g_spawn_async_with_pipes()`
/// eventually calls) paste the argument vector elements together into
/// a command line, and the C runtime startup code does a corresponding
/// reconstruction of an argument vector from the command line, to be
/// passed to ``main()``. Complications arise when you have argument vector
/// elements that contain spaces or double quotes. The `spawn*()` functions
/// don't do any quoting or escaping, but on the other hand the startup
/// code does do unquoting and unescaping in order to enable receiving
/// arguments with embedded spaces or double quotes. To work around this
/// asymmetry, `g_spawn_async_with_pipes()` will do quoting and escaping on
/// argument vector elements that need it before calling the C runtime
/// ``spawn()`` function.

/// 
/// `flags` should be the bitwise OR of any flags you want to affect the
/// function's behaviour. The `G_SPAWN_DO_NOT_REAP_CHILD` means that the
/// child will not automatically be reaped; you must use a child watch
/// (`g_child_watch_add()`) to be notified about the death of the child process,
/// otherwise it will stay around as a zombie process until this process exits.
/// Eventually you must call `g_spawn_close_pid()` on the `child_pid`, in order to
/// free resources which may be associated with the child process. (On Unix,
/// using a child watch is equivalent to calling `waitpid()` or handling
/// the `SIGCHLD` signal manually. On Windows, calling `g_spawn_close_pid()`
/// is equivalent to calling ``CloseHandle()`` on the process handle returned
/// in `child_pid`). See `g_child_watch_add()`.
/// 
/// Open UNIX file descriptors marked as `FD_CLOEXEC` will be automatically
/// closed in the child process. `G_SPAWN_LEAVE_DESCRIPTORS_OPEN` means that

/// in the child. `G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH` means that `argv`[0] need not be an

/// variable. `G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH_FROM_ENVP` means need not be an
/// absolute path, it will be looked for in the `PATH` variable from

/// are used, the value from `envp` takes precedence over the environment.
/// 
/// `G_SPAWN_STDOUT_TO_DEV_NULL` means that the child's standard output

/// 
/// It is valid to pass the same FD in multiple parameters (e.g. you can pass
/// a single FD for both `stdout_fd` and `stderr_fd`, and include it in
/// `source_fds` too).
/// 
/// `source_fds` and `target_fds` allow zero or more FDs from this process to be

/// zero, `source_fds` and `target_fds` must both be non-`nil` and the same length.
/// Each FD in `source_fds` is remapped to the FD number at the same index in
/// `target_fds`. The source and target FD may be equal to simply propagate an FD
/// to the spawned process. FD remappings are processed after standard FDs, so

/// them in the spawned process.
/// 
/// `source_fds` is supported on Windows since 2.72.
/// 
/// `G_SPAWN_FILE_AND_ARGV_ZERO` means that the first element of `argv` is
/// the file to execute, while the remaining elements are the actual
/// argument vector to pass to the file. Normally `g_spawn_async_with_pipes()`
/// uses `argv`[0] as the file to execute, and passes all of `argv` to the child.
/// 
/// `child_setup` and `user_data` are a function and user data. On POSIX
/// platforms, the function is called in the child after GLib has
/// performed all the setup it plans to perform (including creating
/// pipes, closing file descriptors, etc.) but before calling ``exec()``.
/// That is, `child_setup` is called just before calling ``exec()`` in the
/// child. Obviously actions taken in this function will only affect
/// the child, not the parent.
/// 
/// On Windows, there is no separate ``fork()`` and ``exec()`` functionality.
/// Child processes are created and run with a single API call,
/// ``CreateProcess()``. There is no sensible thing `child_setup`
/// could be used for on Windows so it is ignored and not called.
/// 
/// If non-`nil`, `child_pid` will on Unix be filled with the child's

/// or to use `g_child_watch_add()` (or ``waitpid()``) if you specified the
/// `G_SPAWN_DO_NOT_REAP_CHILD` flag. On Windows, `child_pid` will be
/// filled with a handle to the child process only if you specified the
/// `G_SPAWN_DO_NOT_REAP_CHILD` flag. You can then access the child
/// process using the Win32 API, for example wait for its termination
/// with the `WaitFor*()` functions, or examine its exit code with
/// ``GetExitCodeProcess()``. You should close the handle with ``CloseHandle()``
/// or `g_spawn_close_pid()` when you no longer need it.
/// 
/// If non-`nil`, the `stdin_pipe_out`, `stdout_pipe_out`, `stderr_pipe_out`
/// locations will be filled with file descriptors for writing to the child's
/// standard input or reading from its standard output or standard error.
/// The caller of `g_spawn_async_with_pipes()` must close these file descriptors
/// when they are no longer in use. If these parameters are `nil`, the
/// corresponding pipe won't be created.
/// 
/// If `stdin_pipe_out` is `nil`, the child's standard input is attached to
/// `/dev/null` unless `G_SPAWN_CHILD_INHERITS_STDIN` is set.
/// 
/// If `stderr_pipe_out` is NULL, the child's standard error goes to the same

/// 
/// If `stdout_pipe_out` is NULL, the child's standard output goes to the same

/// is set.
/// 
/// `error` can be `nil` to ignore errors, or non-`nil` to report errors.
/// If an error is set, the function returns `false`. Errors are reported
/// even if they occur in the child (for example if the executable in

/// the `G_SPAWN_ERROR` domain.
/// 
/// If an error occurs, `child_pid`, `stdin_pipe_out`, `stdout_pipe_out`,
/// and `stderr_pipe_out` will not be filled with valid values.
/// 
/// If `child_pid` is not `nil` and an error does not occur then the returned

/// 
/// On modern UNIX platforms, GLib can use an efficient process launching
/// codepath driven internally by ``posix_spawn()``. This has the advantage of
/// avoiding the fork-time performance costs of cloning the parent process
/// address space, and avoiding associated memory overcommit checks that are

/// This optimized codepath will be used provided that the following conditions

/// 
/// 1. `G_SPAWN_DO_NOT_REAP_CHILD` is set
/// 2. `G_SPAWN_LEAVE_DESCRIPTORS_OPEN` is set
/// 3. `G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH_FROM_ENVP` is not set
/// 4. `working_directory` is `nil`
/// 5. `child_setup` is `nil`
/// 6. The program is of a recognised binary format, or has a shebang.
